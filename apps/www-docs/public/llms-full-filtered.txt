* Handles JSON serialization and deserialization for complex data types.
* Provides a simple API for reading and updating values.
* Includes error handling for environments where `localStorage` is unavailable (e.g., server-side rendering).

## Server-Side Rendering

This hook checks if `localStorage` is available before accessing it. If used in a non-browser environment (e.g., during server-side rendering), it will return the `defaultValue` without attempting to access `localStorage`.

    type: "T",
  },
}}
/>

### Returns

<TypeTable
  type={{
  value: {
    description: "The current value stored in local storage.",
    type: "T",
  },
  setValue: {
    description: "Function to update the value in local storage.",
    type: "(value: T) => void",

# Installation
URL: /unlogg-hooks/installation

How to use unlogg/hooks in your project

**No installation is required!  🎉**

Since this is a "copy-paste" collection of hooks, you can easily copy the components' code and paste it into your project

You can then modify the code to fit your needs, or use the components as a starting point for building your own.

If you want, you can use the [CLI](/docs/unlogg-ui/cli) to quickly add hooks to your projects.
(This is the same guide and CLI we use for `unlogg/ui`)


# Overview
URL: /unlogg-ui

Build dashboard and web apps faster than ever

## What is unlogg/ui?

**unlogg/ui** is a collection of reusable components and design patterns for building dashboard and web apps. It’s a great way to speed up your design process and create a consistent look and feel across your site.

## How are the components built?

All the components and block are built with `React` and styled with `Tailwind CSS`. This makes it easy to customize the look and feel of the components to match your brand.

Some of the components and blocks also implement `shadcn/ui` components and design patterns (e.g.: global styles, typography, spacing, etc).

## Can I customize the components?

YES! You can customize the components however you like!

Since this is a "copy-paste" library, you can easily copy the components' code and paste it into your project (or install via the CLI). You can then modify the code to fit your needs, or use the components as a starting point for building your own.

## Project structures

The library is made of `components` and `blocks`.

### Components

Components are small, self-contained pieces of UI that can be used in multiple places across your site. They’re designed to be flexible and easy to customize. You can use `components` to build larger `blocks` or use them on their own.

### Blocks

Blocks are larger pieces of UI that are normally made up of multiple components. They’re designed to be used in specific contexts, like a product page or a checkout flow. You can use `blocks` to build entire pages or sections of your site.
