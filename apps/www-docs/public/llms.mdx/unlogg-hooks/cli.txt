Use the CLI to add components, blocks and pages to your project.

<Callout>
  We rely on `shadcn` CLI to add components and blocks to your project.
</Callout>

The CLI provides an easy, interactive way to add components, blocks and pages to your project.
Installing components using the CLI ensures that you have the latest version of the component and its dependencies.

## `init` command

You can use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.

The `init` command installs dependencies, adds the `cn` util and configures CSS variables for the project.

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "bun"]}>
  ```bash tab="pnpm"
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
  ```

  ```bash tab="npm"
  npx shadcn@latest init
  ```

  ```bash tab="bun"
  bun x --bun shadcn@latest init
  ```
</Tabs>

You will be asked a few questions to initialize the project.

## `add` command

You can use the `add` command to add components, blocks and pages to your project.

The `add` command installs dependencies, adds the component, block or page to your project and updates the configuration.

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "bun"]}>
  ```bash tab="pnpm"
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json
  ```

  ```bash tab="npm"
  npx shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json
  ```

  ```bash tab="bun"
  bun x --bun shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json
  ```
</Tabs>

You can use the same command to add shadcn/ui components.

To see a list of all available options, please refer to the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

## Monorepo support

If you need to install the components in a monorepo, you can use the optional `-c` flag.
This will allow you to specify the path to the project where you want to install the component.

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "bun"]}>
  ```bash tab="pnpm"
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json -c ./apps/www
  ```

  ```bash tab="npm"
  npx shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json -c ./apps/www
  ```

  ```bash tab="bun"
  bun x --bun shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/product-card-01-block.json -c ./apps/www
  ```
</Tabs>

Read more about monorepo support using the `shadcn` CLI in the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo).
