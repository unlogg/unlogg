## What are unlogg/hooks?

**unlogg/hooks** is a collection of reusable hooks for building dashboard and web apps. It’s a great way to speed up your development process and create a consistent look and feel across your site.

## How are the hooks built?

All the hooks are built with `React` and are designed to be easy to use and customize. They’re built with TypeScript, so you get all the benefits of type safety and autocompletion in your IDE.

## Can I customize the hooks?

YES! You can customize the hooks however you like!

Since this is a "copy-paste" library, you can easily copy the hooks' code and paste it into your project (or install via the CLI). You can then modify the code to fit your needs, or use the hooks as a starting point for building your own.
