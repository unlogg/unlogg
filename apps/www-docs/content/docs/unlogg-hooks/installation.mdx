**No installation is required!  ðŸŽ‰** 

Since this is a "copy-paste" collection of hooks, you can easily copy the components' code and paste it into your project 

You can then modify the code to fit your needs, or use the components as a starting point for building your own.


If you want, you can use the [CLI](/docs/unlogg-ui/cli) to quickly add hooks to your projects.
(This is the same guide and CLI we use for `unlogg/ui`)
