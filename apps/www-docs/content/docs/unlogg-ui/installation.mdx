This project is built with **Next.js**, using **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for all components.

## 

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install Tailwind CSS

    The components are styled using **Tailwind CSS v.4**.

    Follow the official [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set it up in your project. If you are still using Tailwind CSS v.3, you can follow the [Tailwindcss v.4 migration guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install `lucide-react` icons

    For the components that use icons, we use **Lucide React** icons.

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm install lucide-react
    ```
    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm add lucide-react
    ```
    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun add lucide-react
    ```
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a Utility Helper

    To make it easier to conditionally apply Tailwind CSS classes, add this `cn` helper function to your project.

    ```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
    import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx'
    import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

    export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
      return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
    }
    ```
    
    You might need to install the `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` packages.

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm install clsx tailwind-merge
    ```
    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm add clsx tailwind-merge
    ```
    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun add clsx tailwind-merge
    ```
    </Tabs>
    
  </Step>

  <Step>
   ### Add your first component

    Now that you have set up the required dependencies, you can start adding components to your project.
    
    For example, to add the `StarRating` component, you can just:
    <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm','bun']}>
    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/star-rating-basic-ex-01.json
    ```
    ```bash tab="npm"
    npx shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/star-rating-basic-ex-01.json
    ```
    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun shadcn@latest add https://unlogg.com/r/star-rating-basic-ex-01.json
    ```
    </Tabs>

    And then import the component in your project like: 

    ```ts title="layouts/review.tsx"
    "use client";

    import StarRatingBasic from "@/components/unlogg-ui/test";
    import { useState } from "react";

    export default function Rating() {
      const [rating, setRating] = useState(3);
      return (
        <div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-4">
          <StarRatingBasic value={rating} onChange={setRating} maxStars={5} />
          <p>({rating})</p>
           {/* Rest of your code... */}
        </div>
      );
    }
        ```




  

  <Step>

  ## Done! ðŸŽ‰
      
      You can now manually *copy-paste* the components or use the [CLI](/docs/cli) to add components, blocks, and pages to your project.

      Some components also rely on other third-party libraries like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) and [Motion](https://motion.dev). These dependencies are specified in the component documentation.

    <Callout title="We recommend using the CLI">
      If you are using the CLI to add components, you don't need to worry about the dependencies. The CLI will take care of installing them for you. See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli) for more information.
